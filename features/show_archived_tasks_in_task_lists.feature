Feature: Show archived tasks in task lists
  In order to cut down on page load time
  As a Teambox developer
  I want users to see archived tasks in task lists quickly and easily

  Background:
    Given a project exists with name: "Market Teambox"
    And a confirmed user exists with login: "balint"
    And "balint" is in the project called "Market Teambox"
    And a task list exists with name: "This week"
    And the task list called "This week" belongs to the project called "Market Teambox"
    And the following tasks with associations exist:
      | name                                   | task_list | project        |
      | Tell my friends                        | This week | Market Teambox |
      | Tell the tech bloggers                 | This week | Market Teambox |
    And the task called "Tell my friends" is resolved
    And I am logged in as "balint"

  Scenario: See archived tasks

    When I follow "Show 1 archived task" in the "This week" task list
